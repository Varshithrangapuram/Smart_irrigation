# Smart_irrigation
Smart Irrigation project: Consists of humidity , temperature and moisture sensors which read the values of humidity , temeperature and moisture values . Then this values are used to predict the rainfall at a place using regression problem. I have provided the dataset for it. Then based on the rainfall , we control the pump turn on and off.
We can also predict the crop that will grow based on these conditions using classification model.
